# MP1-2024: Cryptography and Steganography in Java  

**Developed as part of my Computer Science degree coursework**  

## Overview  
This small project was developed during the first semester of my Computer Science degree program. It explores two fundamental concepts in data security: **cryptography** and **steganography**. The goal was to implement basic cryptographic algorithms for encryption and decryption, as well as steganographic techniques to hide information within digital files. The project is entirely terminal-based and focuses on bit-level manipulation to achieve its functionality.  

## Key Concepts  
- **Cryptography**: Implements basic encryption and decryption algorithms to secure data.  
- **Steganography**: Hides data within digital files (e.g., images) by modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of pixel data.  
- **Bit Manipulation**: Works directly with bits and bytes to perform encryption, decryption, and data hiding.  

## Features  
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts and decrypts text or files using a simple cryptographic algorithm.  
- **Data Concealment**: Embeds secret messages into image files using steganography.  
- **Terminal-Based**: The program is command-line driven, with no graphical user interface (UI).  

## How It Works  
1. **Cryptography**:  
   - The program takes user input (text or file) and applies an encryption algorithm to transform it into ciphertext.  
   - The ciphertext can be decrypted back to its original form using a corresponding decryption algorithm.  

2. **Steganography**:  
   - The program embeds secret data (e.g., a message) into an image file by modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image's pixel data.  
   - The hidden data can be extracted from the image by analyzing the LSBs.  

## Why This Project?  
This project was a practical exercise to apply the concepts I learned in my Computer Science coursework. It helped me:  
- Understand the basics of data security, including encryption and steganography.  
- Gain experience with bit-level manipulation and file handling in Java.  
- Develop problem-solving skills by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.  

This project not only helped me develop technical skills but also reinforced my passion for exploring the intersection of security, programming, and problem-solving.
